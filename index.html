        <p id = "change">A luxury car is a car that provides above-average to high-end levels of comfort, features, and equipment.
          Often more expensive materials and surface finishes are used, and buyers expect better build quality. The
          usually higher pricing and more upscale appearance is often associated with higher social status of the users,
          compared to low and mid-market segment cars.</p>

        <p id = "change">A supercar, also known as an exotic car, is a type of automobile generally described as a street-legal,
          luxury superlative performance sports car, both in terms of power, speed, and handling. The term 'supercar' is
          therefore frequently used for low-bodied sportscars with powerful, rear mid-mounted engines.[1] Since the
          2000s, the term hypercar has also come into use for the most high-end performance cars.</p>

            <p id = "change">Sir Frederick Henry Royce, 1st Baronet, OBE (27 March 1863 – 22 April 1933) was an English engineer famous for his designs of car and aeroplane engines with a reputation for reliability and longevity. With Charles Rolls (1877–1910) and Claude Johnson (1864–1926), he founded Rolls-Royce. Rolls-Royce initially focused on large 40–50 horsepower motor cars, the Silver Ghost and its successors. Royce produced his first aero engine shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, and aircraft engines became Rolls-Royce's principal product. Royce's health broke down in 1911, and he was persuaded to leave his factory in the Midlands at Derby and, taking a team of designers, move to the south of England spending winters in the south of France. He died at his home in Sussex in the spring of 1933.</p>
