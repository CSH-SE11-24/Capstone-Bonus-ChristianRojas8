1. My website is an online dealership that includes only cars of a higher caliber such as Exotic hypercars/supercars and Luxury cars like Rolls Royce, and Cadillac. My main target users are those who are on the serach to find their next 1% car, for them to use their money to how they see fit and spend large amounts of money on something they really want, and something they have worked hard for all their life.

2. The feature I am most proud of is on the home page there are some of the founder/owners of some of the car brands on my website and a description next to their pictures and when you hover over the picture of the person the car they created on my website will pop up.

3. A feature I would add if I had more time would be a carousel that would smoothly move past an image every 5 seconds and when someone would hove over one of those images in the carousel a video of the car driving on the road would play and when you clicked on that image it would take you to the place to buy that specific car.

5. I don't rememebr the feedback when I first presented my project but what I did was I added everything I wanted to do the first time that I didn't have enough time to do and as I added in those ideas new ones came in mind and so I just added them
